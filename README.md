  <h1>Bank Management System</h1>
  <p>
    Bank Management System is a web-based application that allows users to perform various banking operations. The system includes features such as CRUD operations, withdraw and deposit cash, and checking details of existing customers.
  </p>
  <h2>Login System</h2>
  <p>
    Before accessing the main system, users are required to pass through a login system to ensure security.
  </p>
  <h2>Customer Record</h2>
  <p>
    When entering a customer's record, the following information is required: IFSC number, Account number, current date, name, date of birth, age, email, address, Aadhar card / PAN number, phone number, the amount deposited while creating an account, and selecting the account type (e.g., Saving, Current, Fixed). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Updating customer information from an existing account is limited to changing the name, address, and phone number.
  </p>
  <h2>Checking Account Details</h2>
  <p>
    Users can check a user's account details using two methods: by Account number or by Account name. The system also provides a listing record that displays customer's name with their Account number, IFSC number, address, and contact details.
  </p>
  <h2>Transactions</h2>
  <p>
    Transactions through the bank can be done by depositing or withdrawing amounts. When a user wants to withdraw or deposit money, they need to provide the amount, and the system will automatically maintain the transaction record and update the total bank balance.
